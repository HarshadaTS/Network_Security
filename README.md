# Resilient Malware Detection over DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
Project Status: Literature Review Phase

This repository documents my journey of building a robust malware detection system for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) traffic that remains effective even under adversarially generated evasive attacks.

Instead of starting directly with code, this repository first focuses on:

1)Understanding the problem deeply

2)Reviewing existing research

3)Identifying gaps

4)Designing a clear research roadmap
